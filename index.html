            <p>We often think and write about others, whether relatives or friends or any other famous personality. In such a case, we forget to write about ourselves. Initially, we should know that we are the most important person in our life. Thinking and writing about ourselves is one of the important things. Now, in this article, check out some set of ten lines that can give you an idea of what you can write about yourself.</p>

               <h2>Realities of Daily Life as a Programmer</h2>
               <p>Reading online every day, I see people write about their wonderful journey toward software development. About how they started from an impoverished situation and are now working in some of the best organizations in the world as developers.
                However, these developers often place more emphasis on the technical stuff you need to know before you become a developer and less about what you need to know in terms of the reality of the everyday life of a developer on the job—issues like how to deal with team members, complete project deadlines, and communicate with your team when you have problems you cannot handle by yourself. </p>

        <p>A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software.

            In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to:
            
            Program a browser (like using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue)
            Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)
            Program a database (like using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)</p>

              <p>Working on a project you are interested in can make the learning process of web design more fun. 

                As a beginner, it could be a bit overwhelming to start a journey without knowing where your destination is. Yes, you want to be a web designer, but that in itself is pretty vague. Set a specific goal to work on a simple project first. Beginning with the end in mind helps you organize the steps you need to take to get to where you want to be.  
                
                Start with a simple project. Complex websites like social media or eCommerce websites might be too tricky if you’re just starting out. An excellent place to start applying what you’re learning would be designing blogs or landing pages. Try out different design trends, like minimalism, maximalism, etc. </p>
